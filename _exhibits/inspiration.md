This project was inspired by [Ashley's sack](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/how-simple-cotton-sack-tells-epic-tale-loss-love-and-resilience-180978009/), [Mary Prince’s narrative](https://docsouth.unc.edu/neh/prince/prince.html), and Black women--like [Harriet Powers](https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/nmah_556462) and my biological foremothers--textile practice.  


I learned about Ashley's sack in my Intro to Digital Humanities course after reading [Tiya Miles's All That She Carried](https://tiyamiles.com/books/all-that-she-carried/)[^1]. Ashley's sack challenged the conventional notion of an archive and caused me to reflect on the experience of slavery from the perspective of a little Black girl.

Tiya Miles shares her thoughts on the experience of Ashley and her mother, Rose, in the video below.

Because of my research interests, I learned a lot about the experiences of Black women, who were constantly subjected to various forms of dehumanization. I saw the images that accompanied them. I was less than displeased because I saw the weak justifications of their abuse, that is their alleged “vulgar” disposition—being a Black woman. This visual project is a manifestation of Venus Monster Syndrome, which I believe explains the ways Black women were and are still seen and treated as “monstrous,” and the ways that they persist by insisting on living. 


My textile uses embroidery to create a counternarrative archive where “monstrous” imaginations are re-presented, to explore the neglected side of Black women’s lives. “Venus Monster Syndrome anlè tèt-la,” is a collaborative project that features the re-presented illustrations of artists who captured different encounters of Black enslaved women, like Mary Prince and Rose Jones.  

I was very selective with the images of this project because I wanted to ensure that I was not recreating a spectacle of their dehumanization. I altered some of the archival images that I included but I followed the original artist’s illustration for the most part. I altered each image to ***re-present*** these women in more vibrant colors not to aestheticize the images, but to create ***contrast*** by drawing the attention of the viewer to focus on the lives of Black women and their ***denied humanity.***

Initially, I included eyes, but I quickly removed them, leaving the space empty because I refused to recreate that spectacle by alluding that we could maintain their gaze—it would feel too colonial. I included my hair to emphasize my biological and postmemorial connection Black women. It is easy to ignore the fact that these women lived lives during slavery since their trauma is the widely circulated tale of their story. It truly seems unfathomable, but Ashley’s sack and Mary Prince’s narrative shows us that ***love was always there.*** I encourage you to read Prince’s narrative and Tiya Miles’s account of Ashley’s sack.

This project adopts critical fabulation to stitch tenderness, care, and vibrancy into the memory of enslaved Black women, which they were denied during their lifetime. Drawing on Marianne Hirsch’s theory of postmemory, I contend that by applying a postmemorial lens to archival images provides contemporary viewers with an alternative way of viewing instances of inhumanity as it requires viewers to actively acknowledge these atrocities, whilst conceiving of the ways in which the dehumanized group asserted their humanity through shared love and intimacy.

Alice Walker relates that our mothers and grandmothers expressed their artistic creativity during a period when they were not welcomed to breathe through daily activities.[^2] Think of their contributions in textile art like crotchet, embroidery, and quilting; meal preparation like crafting utensils and preserving food; personal sanitary care like using herbs to mask perspiration, cure diseases, and abort forced pregnancies; embodied labor like cultivating gardens of flowers and food; and finally entrepreneurship like selling produce.


I created “Venus Monster Syndrome anlè tèt-la” to encourage viewers to imagine the ***magnitude of lives and loves lost.*** Imagine the multitude of names accompanied by memories, cultures, and traditions ***lost.*** Is it unfathomable that these women experienced things outside of pain and shame? Is it wild to imagine that they looked forward to caring for their families and communities and that they were creative in finding solutions to their problems? 


We don’t think about those experiences, we focus on trauma and get overwhelmed by the dehumanizing narrative which I believe is an important part of the story, but it is not the only story. “Venus Monster Syndrome anlè tèt-la” depicts the good, bad, and ugly through a lens that does not seek to judge and condemn, but mourn and remember the known and unknown, changing how they appear within this new archive, a counternarrative archive, to poke the colonial gaze. “Venus Monster Syndrome anlè tèt-la” in its current state is not close to completion. It seems incredibly appropriate to tell stories about our foremothers through a modality that they adopted to tell their own stories. As a counternarrative archive, my embroidery depicts “history [stitched] with and against the archive,” and features varied patterns and my hair with the hope of defying time, space, and archival violence, as well as caring for the memory of my beloved and aiding in becoming myself.
