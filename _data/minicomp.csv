VMS is a worry that is placed on our heads, but rather than become burdened by its harmful weight, we try to find balance and continue to boldly live, and not merely exist, in this world that sees us as 'monstrous.'

obj7,Individual Pictures of Venus Monster Syndrome anlè tèt-la ,Reba K. Dickson,Reba K. Dickson,"“Venus Monster Syndrome anlè tèt-la,” is a project that uses embroidery to create a counternarrative archive, that re-presents archival images of enslaved Black women who were regarded as “monsters” via the colonial gaze and imagination. Venus Monster Syndrome is a concept that I am theorizing for my dissertation. Venus is an adopted name of every individual who identifies as female regardless of their race, whether we know it or not because at any moment, we can experience the fate of millions of Venus’s. The word “Venus” always follows or precedes a qualifier that differentiates the White goddess from the Black version. Why is this qualifier necessary? Venus M. and the “M” is for Monster, is the name of the Black female monster that haunts contemporary Black women’s lives because of their postmemorial connection to enslaved Black women. This connection increases the possibility that they too might endure similar experiences. Venus M. is the name of the misunderstood, masculinized, and Black female “monster,” seen as a body upon which terror reins freely. Venus is (in)visible and (in)dismissible and traumatized. All people who identify as women embody Venus and it comes with its struggles, but I want to focus on Black version of Venus, Venus M., she “beloved, [she] is mine"" (Morrision, Beloved, 256).
