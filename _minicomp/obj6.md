re_presentated_art_description: 'These are the latest updates of the project as of
  June 13, 2024. The project is ongoing and will be included in my disseration as
  a manifestation of a concept that I call "Venus Monster Syndrome, (VMS)," a disease
  that society is infected with which has real-life impact on the physical and pyschological
  beings of Black women. VMS is a worry that is placed on our heads, but rather than
  become burdened by its harmful weight, we try to find balance and continue to boldly
  live, and not merely exist, in this world that sees us as ''monstrous.'' '
