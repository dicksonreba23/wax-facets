re_presentated_art_description: "I selected this image because it is the cover of
  the Mary Prince's narrative account of her enslavement and this project was inspired
  in part by Mary Prince. This image was used by abolitionists following the format
  of <a ref=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/191076\">Josiah Wedgwood's
  Antislavery Medallion</a> to represent the experiences of all enslaved women, becoming
  an icon to represent them. \n"
