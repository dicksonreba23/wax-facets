re_presentated_art_description: '“Venus Monster Syndrome anlè tèt-la,” is a project
  that uses embroidery to create a counternarrative archive, that re-presents archival
  images of enslaved Black women who were regarded as “monsters” via the colonial
  gaze and imagination. Venus Monster Syndrome is a concept that I am theorizing for
  my dissertation. Venus is an adopted name of every individual who identifies as
  female regardless of their race, whether we know it or not because at any moment,
  we can experience the fate of millions of Venus’s. The word “Venus” always follows
  or precedes a qualifier that differentiates the White goddess from the Black version.
  Why is this qualifier necessary? Venus M. and the “M” is for Monster, is the name
  of the Black female monster that haunts contemporary Black women’s lives because
  of their postmemorial connection to enslaved Black women. This connection increases
  the possibility that they too might endure similar experiences. Venus M. is the
  name of the misunderstood, masculinized, and Black female “monster,” seen as a body
  upon which terror reins freely. Venus is (in)visible and (in)dismissible and traumatized.
  All people who identify as women embody Venus and it comes with its struggles, but
  I want to focus on Black version of Venus, Venus M., she “beloved, [she] is mine"
  (Morrision, Beloved, 256).   '
