## Who is Venus? 


“Venus,” in Roman mythology, is the goddess of fertility and love. She is comparable to Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love. Sculptures, like the [Capitoline Venus and/or Venus Pudica](https://www.nga.gov/content/dam/ngaweb/exhibitions/pdfs/venus.pdf) made in honor of the two goddesses depict their silhouettes, naked or loosely draped, their femininity, beauty, and grace regarded as a gift to mankind. Shame and disdain are not associated with them, instead, they are celebrated, loved, and revered. This is quite contrary to Venuses that are associated with Black women who include “Venus, the dead girl,” “Sable Venus,” and “Hottentot Venus.” Venus, the dead girl is referenced in an indictment against a slave ship captain, John Kimber, accused of murdering two Black girls. However, as Saidiya Hartman points out, she could have been present in any other trauma including locales such as a “barracoon, the hollow of the slave ship, the pest-house, the brothel, the cage, the surgeon’s laboratory, the prison, the cane-field, the kitchen, [and] the master’s bedroom.”  Of all these instances wherein this Black Venus appears, little to nothing is known of the nuances of her identity, other than Black and woman, and even less is known about her life.  


Venus is an adopted name of every individual who identifies as female regardless of their race, whether we know it or not because at any moment, we can experience the fate of millions of Venus’s. The word “Venus” always follows or precedes a qualifier that differentiates the White goddess from the Black version. Why is this qualifier necessary? Venus M. and the “M” is for Monster, is the name of the Black female monster that haunts contemporary Black women’s lives because of their postmemorial connection to enslaved Black women. This connection increases the possibility that they too might endure similar experiences. Venus M. is the name of the misunderstood, masculinized, and Black female “monster,” seen as a body upon which terror reins freely. Venus is (in)visible and (in)dismissible and traumatized. All people who identify as women embody Venus and it comes with its struggles, but I want to focus on Black version of Venus, Venus M., she “beloved, [she] is mine”[^1].   

It would be remiss to ignore the significance of the name “Venus” when applied to Black women, because it feels like mockery, big bad words, or another way to add insult to injury. The historical treatment of Black women in Western society shows that they have never been collectively seen or treated as goddesses and they have never been collectively placed on a pedestal for glory and admiration. Why were these women not valued, respected, or even liked? The answer is represented in a simple equation: **Blackness + Femininity= “Monstrosity.”** It might seem disturbing to hear but it is the truth. “Monsters,” this is what is seen when Black women are perceived through the colonial gaze. It is a bizarre phenomenon because it shows the perverseness of the colonial imagination, turning Black women into things, sometimes mechanical, sometimes sexual, always operating. The legacy of this framing is still with us today because society is plagued with a condition that I call __Venus Monster Syndrome (VMS)__. 

To define Venus Monster Syndrome, I draw on Jeffery Jerome Cohen’s notion of “monster” theory, Moya Bailey’s notion of misogynoir, and Kimberle Crenshaw’s notion of intersectionality, which I believe allows me to examine the conditions that engender the objectification and dehumanization of Black women. To establish a connection to historical and contemporary Black women, I draw on Marianne Hirsch’s concept of postmemory, by applying a postmemorial lens to these images, to confront their painful past, challenge archival narratives, and connect contemporary issues.  Venus Monster Syndrome is a disease that damages an individual’s capacity of discerning Black women’s long-standing acquiescence to physical, sexual, and psychological trauma, which resulted in their humanity and femininity becoming mythological. The intersectionality of the social interpretations of their race and gender produces a deep skepticism and suspicion of abuse because their alleged “monstrous” nature prevents individuals from believing that they can feel pain—***only humans feel***. 

Who is Venus? 
Venus is you. 
Venus is me.
